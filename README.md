## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Primitive Framework
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned to use an object from which to take data and manipulate it. It took me some time to manage the counter when it needed to come back.
I also added a function to make the first letters of the name and the job uppercase using a regEx.
For the style part I found a way to make all images the same size (see code below).
It was an interesting and challenging project.

```css
img.img_rew {
  width: 10em;
  height: 10em;
  object-fit: cover;
}
```
